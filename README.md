NBT Safe method of persistent inventory data storage for minecraft


The library takes advantage of native minecraft libraries to create serialized data files just as the game would do naturally between sessions.
Usage allows us to save custom inventories that aren't normally saved by minecraft and at the same time keep the associated nbt data entact.

Compiling requires that it be obfuscated to the version of minecraft for which usage is intended.
